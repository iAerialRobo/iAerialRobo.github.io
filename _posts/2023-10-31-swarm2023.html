  The IUSC, primarily organized by the Chinese Society of Aeronautics and Astronautics in collaboration with Beihang University, China, brought together 18 leading finalist teams this year. Among these were top-tier universities in aerospace engineering in China, such as Beihang University, Northwestern Polytechnical University, and Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics. This event was also competed by the renowned FAST lab team from Zhejiang University, recognized for their groundbreaking work on 'Swarm of Micro Flying Robots in the Wild,' featured on the cover of Science Robotics, along with several other distinguished high-tech drone companies.
