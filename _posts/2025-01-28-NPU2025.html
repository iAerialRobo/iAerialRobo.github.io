<p>
  We are delighted to share the successful conclusion of the third Aerospace Engineering Study Program, organized by the School of Aerospace Engineering at Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) from January 13th to 22nd, 2025. 
  This program, which follows two successful iterations in 2024, welcomed 26 students and faculty members from Northwestern Polytechnical University (NPU), China, continuing the partnership established last year.

  This program was coordinated by us, Dr. Zhou Ye and Dr. Ho Hann Woei, as part of the ongoing effort to strengthen ties between USM and NPU, providing an enriching platform for academic and cultural exchange. 
  It was officially launched by our Dean, Assoc. Prof. Dr. Elmi Abu Bakar, and brought to a close by Deputy Dean, Ir. Dr. Hussin Mamat.

<p>
  Throughout the program, participants had the opportunity to attend a series of specialized lectures that covered topics such as advanced aeronautical technology and aerial robotics. 
  These lectures were delivered by a team of dedicated faculty members, including members, including Prof. Dr. Farzad Ismail, Assoc. Prof. Dr. Ahmad Zulfaa Mohamed Kassim, Assoc. Prof. Dr. Norizham Abdul Razak, Dr. Nurul Musfirah Mazlan, Dr. Mohd Shukur Zainol Abidin, Dr. Chang Wei Shyang, Dr. Zhou Ye, and Dr. Ho Hann Woei.

  In addition to lectures, we arranged hands-on workshops and interactive sessions to provide participants with practical insights into the field of aerospace engineering. 
  These activities allowed participants to engage directly with cutting-edge research and develop a deeper understanding of key concepts in aeronautics and robotics.</p>

  The program was also a wonderful opportunity for cultural exchange. Beyond the classroom, participants explored local heritage and nature while engaging in meaningful interactions that fostered new friendships and a greater appreciation for cultural diversity.
  As coordinators, we are proud to have been part of this programâ€™s journey and its growth over the past year. It was a rewarding experience to see the collaboration between USM and NPU continue to flourish, contributing to academic and research advancements in aerospace engineering.

  We extend our gratitude to the organizing committee and our colleagues for their invaluable support, and we look forward to hosting similar programs in the future to strengthen global academic partnerships and inspire the next generation of aerospace engineers.
